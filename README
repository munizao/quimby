*** Introduction

Quimby is a GTK+ input method which has some extra features that I found lacking in the default gtk input method. Among these are extra compose sequences, the ability to paste from the Primary selection, and the ability to toggle capitalization.
When this has been installed, you can choose the "quimby" menu item from the "Input Methods" submenu when right-clicking in a GTK+ text entry area. In most cases it will automatically be the default input method once installed.
